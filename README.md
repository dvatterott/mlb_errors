# Are some player more likely to hit into errors than others?

Quick analysis of retrosheet.org data to investigate whether some players are more likely to hit into errors than other players. 

Using bash, and python (3.6; pandas 0.20.3; scipy 1.0.0). 

Run by calling ./get_data.sh YEAR where year is the year of interest (e.g., 2017) then python analysis.py YEAR (again where year is the year of interest).

Looking at 2017 and 2018 data there's no evidence that some players are more likely to hit into errors than other players.
